LoStaR
======

LoStaR stands for Logic States Recorder, i.e. a recorder able to save many hours of slow speed logic states to monitor and debug a device featuring relatively
slow speed hardware communication lines or action  lines.

The project is composed by three subprojects

**Capture** - a C console application for linux that samples the digital lines on a parallel port

**lostar** - a WPF application working on Windows only that shows on a timeline the logic states.
